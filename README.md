# Cryptocurrency Wallet Application

## Introduction

Nearing the start of 2021, I started to research a lot about blockchain technology and its applications, one of them being cryptocurrency. Since then, I've been quite intrigued by the extensive applications and capabilities of cryptocurrency. Therefore, I decided to base this project on my interest and passion for cryptocurrency by programming a cryptocurrency wallet application.

This program models a digital cryptocurrency wallet that allows cryptocurrency owners to store their cryptocurrency in a wallet. The wallet will also allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrency.

## User Stories

3. As a user, I want to be able to view the balances of my wallet in my account.

6. As a user, I want to be give the option to load my Account from file on startup.
