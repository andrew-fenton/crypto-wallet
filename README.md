# Cryptocurrency Wallet Application

## Introduction

Nearing the start of 2021, I started to research an ample amount about blockchain technology and its applications, one of them being cryptocurrency. Since then, I've been quite intrigued by the extensive applications and capabilities of cryptocurrency. Therefore, I decided to base this project on my interest and passion for cryptocurrency by programming a cryptocurrency wallet application.

This program models a digital cryptocurrency wallet which allows cryptocurrency owners to store their cryptocurrency in a wallet which is password protected. The wallet will also allow users to buy, sell, and transfer cryptocurrency.
