# Cryptocurrency Wallet Application

## Introduction

Nearing the start of 2021, I started to research an a lot about blockchain technology and its applications, one of them being cryptocurrency. Since then, I've been quite intrigued by the extensive applications and capabilities of cryptocurrency. Therefore, I decided to base this project on my interest and passion for cryptocurrency by programming a cryptocurrency wallet application.

This program models a digital cryptocurrency wallet that allows cryptocurrency owners to store their cryptocurrency in a wallet. The wallet will also allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrency.
